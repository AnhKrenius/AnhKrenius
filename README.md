## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Anh Nguyen**.

I build **AI-powered analytics products** that turn complex signals into **clear, actionable insights**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning, system design, and product thinking** — focusing on solutions that **ship**, **scale**, and **create real impact**.

I’m especially interested in **applied AI**, where models are only valuable if they help people make better decisions. My experience spans Data Engineering, Data Science, and Analytics, allowing me to work comfortably across the entire data lifecycle.

## 🧩 Data Roles I Work Across

### 🔧 Data Engineering
- Designing and maintaining scalable **data ingestion pipelines** from multiple sources
- Building **ETL workflows** for clean, analytics-ready datasets
- Managing cloud-native infrastructure for data reliability and performance
- Optimizing data workflows with monitoring, validation, and logging

### 📊 Data Analytics
- Translating business questions into **KPIs, metrics, and dashboards**
- Designing data models to support BI and reporting use cases
- Performing exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and patterns
- Communicating insights clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders

### 🤖 Data Science & AI
- Applying machine learning and NLP to real-world data problems
- Building AI-powered analytics features for production platforms
